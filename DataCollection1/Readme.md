# Full Stack Project - Data Collection 1
# Purpose
Students will begin modeling data from their chosen source. Existing data will be studied and modeled into a more usable format appropriate for the project.

# Instructions
At this point, you should have created a main.py file in your project and worked with it to a
degree using Git and your local IDE.
In this part of the project there will be a single submission of the link to your project on Github,
however multiple tasks will be graded by reviewing the repository.

# Part1: The Data Model
Data created by third-party entities often has pieces of information that are not necessary and
other pieces that are. Based on the scope of your chosen project, you must decide what is
relevant and what should be discarded.
You are to create a visual model of how your data will be stored. You should include each piece
of data and how different data are related to one another. Using a drawing tool, you should
create this diagram to show the pieces of data and how they relate. You may choose any
software you prefer to create the diagram. It’s recommended that you use http://draw.io or
Microsoft Visio. However, there are many other tools available that will create a similar
diagram.

Review the example at https://github.com/stevenhelms/ee3503-project or other sources. A formal
diagram would require specific arrow types on how the data relates. It is important to consider these
relationships. For example, the class hotel example models one hotel with many ratings and one hotel
with many reviews. I would expect that in each case it may be possible to have zero or more ratings and
reviews for one hotel. The arrows represent this relationship. When using draw.io, you can find the
arrows as part of the Entity Relationship Diagram arrows available.

To complete this part of the project, you are to do the following:
• Place a copy of the original diagram (draw.io, Visio, etc) in your project repository
• Place an image of the diagram (PNG, JPG, etc) in your repository
• Submit a link to the repository in Blackboard.
